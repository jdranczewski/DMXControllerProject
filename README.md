An assembly program for a PIC18 microprocessor that implements the DMX512 Protocol and transmits the data at 15.3 Hz to PORT C pins (pin 0 for data, pin 1 for inverted data). Data transmitted is controlled with user input via a keyboard (PORT E) and a dial (PORT A, pin 0), and the user interface is displayed on a 16x2 LCD character display.
